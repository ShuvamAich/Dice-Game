# Dice-Game

This is a Dice Game I created using basic HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This is a project which is part of a JavaScript course that I am currently pursuing on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Scope of Improvement:
--> Two dices can be used instead of one. In that case, the target score can be increased to 100.
--> Other innovative ideas, if any.
